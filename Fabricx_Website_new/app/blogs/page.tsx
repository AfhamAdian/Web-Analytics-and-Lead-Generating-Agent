            <p>
              The Ready-Made Garments (RMG) industry is the lifeblood of Bangladesh‚Äôs economy, contributing over 80% of total exports and employing nearly 4 million workers. However, inefficiencies in supply chain management (SCM) are hindering growth, raising concerns about sustainability and competitiveness in the global market.
            </p>
            <p>
              With global buyers now prioritizing lead time, compliance, and sustainability over just cost, the time has come for the Bangladesh RMG sector to rethink its supply chain strategies.

            <p>
              On February 26, 2010, a devastating fire broke out at the Garib & Garib Sweater Factory in Gazipur, Bangladesh, claiming the lives of at least 21 workers due to toxic smoke inhalation and the lack of proper emergency exits. This tragedy was one of many industrial disasters that exposed the fire hazards in garments and the dire need for better textile factory safety regulations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fifteen years later, Bangladesh&apos;s Ready-Made Garment (RMG) industry has made significant progress in improving workplace safety, yet fire risks remain a major concern. Advances in AI fire prevention in RMG, IoT-based fire detection, and smart automation now present a game-changing opportunity to prevent such disasters.

            Bangladesh&apos;s Suspension of Yarn Imports from India: Causes, Implications, and Path Forward
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Bangladesh&apos;s National Board of Revenue (NBR) has suspended the import of yarn from India through land ports effective April 15, 2025. This decision marks a significant shift in the textile trade dynamics between the two neighboring countries and highlights the ongoing tensions between protecting domestic industries and ensuring a competitive manufacturing sector.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#f2f827]">Motivations Behind the Suspension</h3>
            <p>
              The primary driver was advocacy from the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA), backed by a recommendation from the Trade and Tariff Commission to halt land‚Äëport imports and bolster domestic yarn usage.

            </ul>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#f2f827]">Supply Chain Dynamics</h3>
            <p>
              Indian yarn is warehoused in Kolkata and shipped via land ports, offering speed and cost advantages that undercut local producers.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#f2f827]">Historical Evolution of Yarn Imports</h3>
            <p>
              Imports rose to 12.15 lakh tonnes in 2024 (31.45% ‚Üë from 2023), valued at $3‚ÄØbillion, with January 2025 figures hitting 36,735‚ÄØM‚ÄØBDT.
